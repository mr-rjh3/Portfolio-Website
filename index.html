            <h4>
                Hello, my name is Riley Huston and I make things! 
            </h4>
            <p>
                I am an asipring Fullstack Developer and I'm very passionate about making things that people like to use. I am currently a student at Wilfrid Laurier University studying Computer Science with a minor in User Experience Design.
            </p>

            <p>
                My goal is to create applications and services that people want to use. I am a motivated programmer that picks things up very quickly and I am always looking to learn new things. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy gaming and I am a huge fan of Nintendo. Some of my favourite gaming franchises are Nintendo IPs such as: The Legend of Zelda, Xenoblade Chronicles, and Super Smash Brothers.
                My love of gaming has extended into video game production and design and I want to someday make my own video game.
            </p>

            <p>
                I Developed this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                I used Vite for the front-end architechture and Node.js for the back-end.
                It's my first time developing a website and I had a lot of fun with it!
                It's currently being hosted using Git-Hub Pages and you can find the source code in the repository linked.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cardcade is a game I designed and created with the help of one of my friends!
                We created it for Mini Jam 104, which is an event where you must create a game within 72 hours while adhering to a given limitation.
                It was my first time creating a game using Unity so it was an amazing learning expereince for me as the scope of our game grew and I got to experiment with more features. 
                We placed 1st in Entertainment, Use of Limitation, and Concept categories while we placed 2nd in Presentation netting us an overall 1st place victory.
                I was very proud of our game and I hope to continue to develop it as I am very interested in creating games. 
                Feel free to check it out as well!

            <p>
                This is a presentation I put together with the assistance of 4 other teammates which we presented to a senior manager at the Royal Bank of Canada.
                We were tasked with redesigning thier internal learning portal as it's current design was outdated and unintuitve.
                The presentation showcases many of our prototypes and iterations along with our final high fidelity prototype created using photoshop.
                We designed our prototype with a focus on organization and ease of use for the employees.
                Overall it was a great experience for me as I learned how to identify user frustrations and pain points while designing methods to alleviate them by way of a simpler, intuitive design.
                It was also a great experience for developing mulitple fidelity prototypes and iterating through them in an agile development enviroment to find the best solution.

            <p>
                Studdy Buddy is an Software I developed along with a team of 8.
                It is a focus assistance app that attempts to stop distractions from getting in the way of your work by displaying a warning message to inform you that you're unfocused. 
                We designed a "gameified" aspect to it by allowing users to earn coins the longer they stay focused, which they may spend on dressing thier "Studdy Buddy" in various clothing styles or furnishing the room the reside in. 
                It was my first time creating an application of this scale and I learned a lot about the different ways to structure an app and the importance of proper documentation, which prevents miscommunications from occuring.

            <p>
                A friend and I attempted a machine learning programming challenge on Kaggle.com where we were required to score around 23 500 reviews based on the sentiment of thier text and titles. 
                We acomplished this using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and machine learning concepts. 
                The accuracy we achieved was around 75% - 80% on the test set of data. 
                We also plotted many different relationships between the data we were given using various graphs such as, histograms, pie charts, box plots, and line graphs using the 3 libraries: Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib.
